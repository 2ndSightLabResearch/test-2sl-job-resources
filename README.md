# Resources shared accros jobs
This repository contains platform specific resources that may be shared across jobs.

For example, these two jobs exist in the 2sl-jobs repository:

awsorginit - to initialize a brand new AWS account
awsenvinit - to initialize your initial job execution environment
awsdeploy - to deploy resources once you have an execution environment in place

All the above jobs share the AWS CloudFormation templates in this repository.

For more information see the 2sl-job-exec repository README.
